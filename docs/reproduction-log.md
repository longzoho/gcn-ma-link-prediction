## Plan 1: Foundation (GCN_MA on CollegeMsg)

### Hyperparameters not specified in the paper

| Param | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `hidden_dim` | 128 | EvolveGCN convention; fits 12GB RTX 3060 |
| `num_heads` | 8 | Transformer convention; 128/8 = 16 head dim |
| `lr` | 1e-3 | Adam default for GCN family |
| `optimizer` | Adam | Standard |
| `weight_decay` | 1e-5 | Light regularization, standard |
| `epochs` | 200 with patience 20 | Standard for dynamic LP |
| `dropout` | 0.1 (attention + MLP) | Standard |
| `grad_clip_max_norm` | 5.0 | Anti-explode for LSTM cell |
| `β` | 0.8 (fixed for Plan 1) | Paper recommends [0.7, 0.9]; Plan 2 will grid-search |

### Choices beyond paper

- **Negative sampling:** Uniform random with rejection. 1:1 positive:negative ratio. Per-epoch resampling for training, fixed for validation and test (seed 999). Shared across all models.
- **Test pairs cached with seed 999** to keep evaluation identical when other models are added in later plans.
- **Node features for GCN_MA:** `[degree, CC, AS]` per snapshot, recomputed every snapshot. Baselines (later plans) will use one-hot identity.
- **Train/val/test split (spec §6.4):** training targets snapshots `[1, ⌊0.8T⌋)`; val target is snapshot `⌊0.8T⌋`; test targets are snapshots `[⌊0.8T⌋+1, T-1]`. Pooled AUC/AP across all test steps. Training never targets the val or test snapshots (no leakage).

### Resolved issues

(populate as bugs are found and fixed)

### Known limitations

- Hyperparameters tuned on CollegeMsg only; later plans will validate on additional datasets.
- TBPTT not yet implemented; will be added when reaching EUT (T=127) in Plan 2.
